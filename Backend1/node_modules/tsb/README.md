> Not just another general purpose IDE. The **best** one for TypeScript.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TypeScriptBuilder/tsb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TypeScriptBuilder/tsb)

> ⚠️ This project is not ready. Lookout for final release by about 2017 (patience and persistence), just making it public to be clear on *what I am working on*. 🌟 it to help it move along 🌹

**Why TypeScript?**

You can build *complete* applications with a single language > this means you can have dev tools (like this) that can understand *your entire project*.

**Why another IDE (not atom / vscode / brackets)?**

Fundamental differences:
* This is TypeScript first. We want to provide the **greatest** development and analysis experience for TypeScript. Every feature revolves around this goal, and we have features unique to TypeScript development.
* [Super easy to setup](https://github.com/TypeScriptBuilder/tsb/tree/master#usage). Just `npm install` and open your browser.

There are lots of [other reasons why you might use this project OR use the source code](https://github.com/basarat/tsb/blob/master/docs/contributing/why.md). Effectively this is `transpiler`, `editor`, `analyzer`, `DX workflow` rolled into one.

## Requirements
This is a forward looking project that plans to use the latest tech as it becomes available:

* You need the latest version of NodeJS (at least v4).
* You need Google Chrome.

That is it!

## Usage

> Till we consider it stable for release we are not pushing to NPM. So for now you need to get it using the [CONTRIBUTING guide](https://github.com/basarat/tsb/blob/master/docs/contributing/README.md).

Get it:
```
npm install tsb -g
```

Run it passing in the directory you want to serve up:
```
tsb .
```

Now open it in your favorite browser (pssst `chrome`) at the URL mentioned in your console. (**protip** use `tsb -o`)

## Command Line
All of these are **optional**:

* `-o`: Open the browser on the server
* `-d <directory>` : Specify a working directory
* `-p <port>`: Specify a custom port number
* `--safe`: To ignore any previous session data in `.tsb` folder
