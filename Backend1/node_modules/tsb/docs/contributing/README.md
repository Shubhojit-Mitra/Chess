# Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/typescriptbuilder/tsb.git
cd tsb
npm install
npm link
```

Now you can run `tsb`

We highly recommend you use [`nodemon`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon), just run it from the project root:

```
npm install nodemon -g
nodemon
```

If you edit any front-end ts file our Webpack setup (more on this later) will reload the front end only. Make a change to some backend file and the app restarts :rose:

# After moving a new machine
I quite often work on my personal laptop during my 1 hour one way commute and need to setup the machine quickly, so on the new machine:

```
npm run resume
```

This will just run the right things again (pull + install + initial compile).

# IDE
We presently use [`atom-typescript`](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript). Eventually this project should be self hosting.

```
atom .
```

We critically use it for fast `.ts` -> `.js` workflow.

# Webpack
All our front-end js gets minified into `bundle.js`. This is what gets npm deployed.

For dev time we have a setup (all code in `devtime.ts`) where we start a `WebpackDevServer` and proxy the `bundle.js` requests to it, additionally loading the hot loader to refresh our UI if any front-end JS changes.

The meanings of some key folders:
```
src/app            -> all our front-end (main entry point called `main.ts`)
src/public/build   -> bundle.js and other generated resources go here
src/server         -> our backend code (main entry point called `server.ts`)
src/common         -> Shared between server /client. No server or client only code.
webpack.config.ts  -> our webpack config shared between devtime and what gets npm deployed
```

In addition to that we make it easier to test the app as it would appear after npm publish:

* Visit `/prod` to see the app as it would work after npm publish and then test app. Live reload will be disabled.
* Visit `/dev` to go back to the dev time workflow.
